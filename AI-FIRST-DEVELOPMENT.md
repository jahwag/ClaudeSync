# AI-First Development Guide: Leveraging Claude AI for Efficient Software Development

## Introduction

This guide outlines best practices for adopting an AI-first development approach using Claude AI, with a special focus on the Master Plan methodology. The Master Plan approach ensures systematic development by creating a detailed implementation plan before any coding begins. This methodology has been compiled from feedback provided by multiple developers and product owners at cplace who have successfully implemented it in their workflows.

## The Master Plan Approach

### What is a Master Plan?

A Master Plan is a comprehensive markdown document that outlines the complete implementation strategy for a feature or project. It serves as:
- A roadmap for implementation
- A basis for task breakdown
- A foundation for documentation

It is created with Claude AI.

## Development Workflow with Master Plan

### 1. Planning Phase

1. **Context Setting**

- Create New Project in Claude.ai for the feature or area of the codebase you are working on.
- Set up the project context using the `claudesync` command-line tool. Refer to the instructions in this [README.md](https://github.com/tbuechner/ClaudeSync/blob/master/README.md) on how to configure and use `claudesync`.

2. **Context Management Best Practices**

- Good: 
   - Keep project context below 50% of the knowledge capacity for optimal performance
  - For large codebases, segment context by feature area
  - Only sync complete, working files using claudesync
  - Use component diagrams to maintain structural understanding
  - Monitor quality degradation as context size increases
  - Regularly clean and update context to maintain relevance
  - If you are unfamiliar with the area of the codebase then prompt Claude to help with the context creation process
  - In some use cases the project context can be optional

- Bad:
  - Uploading entire codebase without filtering
  - Including auto-generated files, dependencies, or build artifacts
  - Syncing incomplete or non-working features


3. **First Prompt**

 ```markdown
   "I need to create an implementation plan for [feature name]. Here's what I have:
   
   Requirements:
   - [List key requirements]
   
   Current System Context:
   - [Relevant system information]
   - [Technical constraints]
   - [Integration points]
   
   Please:
   1. Ask any clarifying questions about the requirements
   2. Once requirements are clear, create a detailed implementation plan
   3. Break down the implementation into logical steps
   4. Include error handling, testing and documentation
```

4. **Requirements Clarification**
   - Prompt Claude to ask questions
   - Prompt Claude to not generate code yet
   - Provide detailed answers
   - Iterate on requirements

5. **Plan Generation**
   - Get initial plan draft
   - Review and request modifications
   - Finalize and upload the generated plan to the project's knowledge base

6. **Optional: Plan Template**

Prompt Claude to use template for the Master Plan document:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[High-level description of the feature]

## Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
  [...]

## Dependencies
- Technical dependencies
- System dependencies
- External service dependencies

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1 name]
   - Details
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical considerations

[Continue with additional steps...]

## Testing Strategy
[Outline of testing approach]

## Documentation Requirements
[Documentation needs]
```

### 2. Implementation Phase

Start separate chats for each step in the plan:

1. **Step-by-Step Development**
   ```markdown
   "I'm implementing Step 2 (Security Validation) from the Master Plan.
   Previous step implemented:
   - Version detection system
   - API integration
   
   Please generate code following the plan:
   1. Generate checksum verification code
   2. Include error handling
   3. Add logging
   4. Generate unit tests
   "
   ```

2. **Validation and Iteration**
   - Validate each step
   - Prompt Claude for potential risks in the proposed implementation or for alternative implementation
   - Iterate based on the feedback
   - Update the Master Plan if needed

3. **Code Review and Validation**
   - Request code explanations
      - Ask Claude to explain important decisions
      - Request rationale for specific implementations
   - Explore alternatives
      - Ask for different approaches
      - Compare trade-offs
   - Review the implemented code
      - Refactor if necessary
   - Test thoroughly
      - Generate unit tests
      - Validate edge cases
      - Test integration paths

4. **Documentation**
   - Create meaningful commit messages
   - Document key decisions
   - Upload the changed files to the project's knowledge base by using the `claudesync push` command
   - Optionally: open PR for the implemented steps and generate the PR description by prompting Claude

## Best Practices for Master Plan Approach

### Effective Conversation Management

- Start new conversations when:
   - Current chat becomes too long
   - Switching to a new implementation step
   - Current context becomes unclear
- Use focused prompting to avoid reaching limits
- Specify preferred response styles (concise vs. explanatory)
- Structure conversations around single tasks or features

### Communicating Expertise Levels
- Specify your technical background
  Example: "I have advanced Python knowledge but limited Angular experience"
- Highlight specific areas where you need detailed explanations
- Request appropriate level of technical detail in responses
- Ask for additional resources or learning materials when needed

## Conclusion

The Master Plan approach provides:
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Documented decision making
- Structured development process

Success with this approach depends on:
- Thorough initial planning
- Regular plan updates
- Thorough review and testing
- Consistent documentation
