# AI Adoption Masterplan: Enhancing Software Development with Claude AI

## Executive Summary

This masterplan outlines the structured introduction of Claude AI across the software development process, with particular focus on requirements analysis, planning, and prototyping phases. The plan aims to improve documentation quality, streamline prototyping, and establish effective knowledge sharing practices across squads.

## 1. Priority Areas and Goals

### 1.1 High Priority: Shaping
**Goal:** Enhance the shaping process through AI-assisted analysis and planning

**Key Benefits:**
- More thorough shaping sessions with AI-driven exploration
- Better identification of project boundaries and risks
- Clearer solution space definition
- Enhanced written solution sketches with detailed technical considerations

**Implementation Focus:**
- Mandatory use of AI during shaping sessions
- AI-assisted risk assessment and appetite definition
- Systematic documentation of shaping outcomes in pitch format
- Enhanced breadboarding and technical exploration

### 1.2 High Priority: Prototyping
**Goal:** Accelerate and improve prototype development across all types (UI, technical spikes, performance)

**Key Benefits:**
- Faster iteration on potential solutions
- More thorough exploration of alternatives
- Reduced time to validate technical approaches

**Implementation Focus:**
- Recommended use of AI for all prototyping activities
- Structured approach to prototype documentation
- AI-assisted feasibility analysis

### 1.3 High Priority: Development Support (Code Generation)
**Goal:** Enhance development efficiency while maintaining code quality
